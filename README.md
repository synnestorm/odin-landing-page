# Odin Landing Page

This is an assignment from "The Odin Project". Design and style guide is provided.

The goal: "Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect".

Comments afterward:

I made the decision to make the landing page into a car landing page. I also made the design responsive, although that was not part of the assignment.
